This semester (Fall, 2023) when I was solving the numerical engineering problems both analytically and using coding simulations, I gained new perspective on the following topics:
1.	Taylor Series Expansion Insight
2.	Pade Approximants Mastery
3.	Naive Gauss Elimination Proficiency
4.	Gauss Elimination with Partial Pivoting Expertise
5.	Ill-conditioned System Evaluation
6.	Stiff ODE Handling
7.	Romberg Integration Application
